<h3>Comprehensive view</h3>
<hr>
<p>The "CNN Image Classification" project focuses on categorizing images as either displaying happiness or sadness using deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The implementation is done in Python, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The model is trained on a dataset of images that are labeled as either happy or sad, and after training, it is used to predict the emotional category of new, unseen images.</p>

<h3>Implementation </h3>
<P>The project was implemented using Google Colab, following these steps:</P>
<ul>
  <li>Downloaded happy and sad images from Google and stored them separately</li>
  <li>Zipped the image folders and hosted them on a GitHub repository.</li>
  <li>In the Colab environment, wrote a python script to unzip the data.</li>
  <li>The dataset was labeled using TensorFlow.</li>
  <li>Images with a size less than 10KB were removed to improve data quality.</li>
  <li>A deep CNN model was constructed, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras.</li>
  <li>The model was trained using the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric.</li>
  <li>After training, loss and accuracy metrics were calculated.</li>
  <li>Unseen happy and sad images were used to make predictions using the trained model.</li>
</ul>
